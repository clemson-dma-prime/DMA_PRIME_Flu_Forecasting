# Predicting Hospital Encounters with Infectious Diseases (COVID-19, Influenza, RSV) in Regions and Counties of South Carolina Utilizing State Predictions

## Overview

This repository provides a flexible and scalable framework to distribute infectious disease–related hospitalizations (COVID-19, influenza, RSV) from statewide projections to smaller geographic units: counties and regions in South Carolina.

The approach integrates:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) from MUSC and Prisma Health,
- Hospital admission data from the SC Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (RFA) office,
- Machine learning (XGBoost) models optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.
